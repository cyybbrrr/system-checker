# System-Tools
A free release for checking HWIDs, as well as ARP and the ability to add entries to ARP, delete entries, and flush it entirely.

## What this does:

**View Hardware Serials**: This fetches most system HWIDs, such as Motherboard, Disks, SMBIOS, Motherboard and MAC Address.

**Display ARP Information**: Does exactly what is intended - shows you your ARP information. You will also be given options to add entries, delete specific entries or flush all entries entirely.

## Known, current issues:

*GPU only displays the name, not the actual ID tied to the GPU.*

*The hardware exporter currently does not work, this will be fixed in the **near future**.*

*The MAC Address on the checker is only the cached MAC Address, not the actual **kernel** MAC Address.*
